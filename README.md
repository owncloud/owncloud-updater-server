### License Migration to Apache 2.0

The OSPO is driving a strategic relicensing of ownCloud repositories toward the
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), following
the [Apache Software Foundation's third-party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).

Individual repositories will migrate as their audit is completed. The LICENSE file
in each repo reflects its **current** license status (not the target).

**Current license: MIT** (Category A per Apache policy -- permissive, compatible with Apache-2.0).

Migration prerequisites for this repository:

- **CLA/DCO coverage**: All past contributors must have signed agreements permitting relicensing
- **Header updates**: All source file headers must be updated from MIT to Apache-2.0 notice
- **Dependency audit**: Verify no incompatible transitive dependencies
